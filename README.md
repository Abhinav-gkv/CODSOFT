1. Titanic Survivor Prediction Project Overview This project uses the famous Titanic dataset to predict which passengers survived the tragedy. By analyzing features such as age, gender, class, and fare, the model determines the likelihood of survival. It demonstrates basic data preprocessing, feature engineering, and supervised machine learning classification techniques.
Techniques Used Data cleaning and handling missing values Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Feature engineering Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree Accuracy and confusion matrix for evaluation Dataset Source: Kaggle Titanic Dataset

2. Iris Species Classification Project Overview This beginner-friendly project classifies iris flowers into one of three species—Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica—based on sepal and petal dimensions. It's a classic multiclass classification task widely used for learning supervised learning models. Techniques Used Data visualization with Seaborn and Matplotlib Label encoding Train/test split Classification using Logistic Regression, KNN, and SVM Accuracy score and classification report Dataset Source: Kaggle IRIS Dataset
   
3. Sales Prediction with Advertising Data Project Overview This project predicts product sales based on advertising spend across TV, radio, and newspapers. It's a regression task that helps businesses make data-driven marketing decisions by analyzing the impact of different advertising channels. Techniques Used Linear Regression modeling Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Correlation analysis and heatmaps Model evaluation using R² score and Mean Squared Error Dataset Source: Kaggle advertising.csv Dataset
